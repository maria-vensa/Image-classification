# Image-classification
# Project Name: Image Classification using Deep Learning
# Overview
This project aims to analyze data, perform data augmentation, and develop deep learning models capable of accurately classifying natural images into six categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. The project utilizes a dataset comprising natural images of size 150x150 pixels, with a training set consisting of six folders containing approximately 2,300 images for each category. Additionally, a testing set of 3,050 images is provided for evaluating the models' performance.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of natural images representing various categories. The images are resized to a uniform size of 150x150 pixels to ensure consistency during training and testing. The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set contains six folders, each corresponding to one of the six image categories, with approximately 2,300 images in each folder. The testing set comprises 3,050 images that will be used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

# Model and Technology
This project utilizes the TensorFlow framework, a popular open-source deep learning library, to build and train the image classification models. TensorFlow provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions that enable efficient development and training of deep neural networks. The chosen deep learning model architecture will be tailored to the specific requirements of the image classification task.

# Execution Steps
To reproduce the results and perform the image classification, follow these steps:

**Dataset Acquisition**: 
Download the dataset from the Kaggle website or obtain it from an alternative source.
**Data Preprocessing**:

Prepare the dataset by resizing the images to a consistent size of 150x150 pixels and organizing them into the appropriate folder structure.
**Data Augmentation**:

Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the variability of the training data and enhance the model's ability to generalize.
**Model Development**:

Implement deep learning models using TensorFlow to perform the image classification task. Experiment with different architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to achieve the best performance.
**Model Training**:

Train the deep learning models using the augmented training data. Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size, to optimize the model's performance.
**Model Evaluation**: 

Evaluate the trained models using the testing set of 3,050 images. Measure metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the models' effectiveness.
**Results Analysis**: 

Record the performance of the trained models on the testing set. Save the results in an Excel spreadsheet or any other suitable format for further analysis and comparison.
**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the process of image classification using deep learning techniques. By analyzing the provided dataset, applying data augmentation, and building suitable deep learning models, we aim to accurately classify natural images into six categories. 
The TensorFlow framework serves as a powerful tool for implementing and training these models. The evaluation results of the trained models are recorded in an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis and comparison.
